			    My personal interests include:
        </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				 <b>Machine learning</b>. I have always had a keen interest in machine learning and AI since before my university days. I'm always
				  looking for, or developing new ways to efficiently clean and analyze data.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Music</b>. Music has been my passion since childhood. While i do like to sing and strum along the guitar every now and then,
				  what excites me is to find ways to mash up or mix up music, especially with all the available software.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Social Work</b>. My family and I started "Dr Vijayalakshmi Basavaraj Charitable Society" in my mothers name, 
				  after she passed away in 2011. As part of the charitable society, we provide yearly scholarships to meritorious students at
				  the school for the visually impaired and the school for the hearing handicapped at Mysore,India. We also hold yearly 
				  educational lectures and music concerts as part for the society.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Travelling</b>. I love travelling to new places, and experiencing the local culture and cuisines. 
      </li>

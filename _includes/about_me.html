            I am a seasoned software developer, software architect and data scientist, having over 12 years experience.
	    While I'm proficient in both application development and systems programming, my expertise lies in designing 
            and building complex event processing systems and data driven analytical systems. This includes algorithmic
            trading systems, order management systems and data analysis frameworks
        </p>
        <p>
           I am a hands on technical leader, having evolved many trading systems, and also built various software products from the ground up.
           I have headed an algorithmic trading desk, and have an over-arching understanding of the workings of financial software systems.
           I have also specialized in machine learning and algorithm analysis, and possess an inherent love for all things data.
